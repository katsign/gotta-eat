## *Description*
This application uses Handlebars and Express to serve static files in a dynamic way and sources data from a connected MySQL database. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page — waiting to be devoured. This can then be clicked into the "Devoured" section. The app will store every burger in a database, devoured or not. 

## *Installation*
### Open the repository folder in your prefered code editor and pull up the built-in terminal. You will need Node.js installed to run this application.
- Type `npm i` to pull the project dependencies to your local.
- Navigate to the `/config` folder and update the MySQL connection information to match your own Workbench instance.

## *Usage*
